<h1>Quick intro</h1>
This project is a small project for me to practice my C++, Python, and OpenCV skills.
The project consists of an image scanner written in C++ using OpenCV library. Additionally, I wanted to use Telegram API to create a useful bot to get free scans without any ads. I do scans a lot for schools and other reasons, so I thought that will be useful. Eventually I want to be able to create .pdf files to completely stop using other proprietary software.
<h1>Progress</h1>
I am still working on making final changes and publishing the final version.
